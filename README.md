This is an application that aims to make GitHub more socially engaging.<br>

![alt text](Preview/repository-hunter.gif " The view of the application")<br>

The application provides 2 kinds of services: 
* The first engaing feature is the **_Fun Facts_**. This mets the curiosity of a human to peek into the progress/ work accomplished by other users. Several engaging facts are presented which when observed closely povides deep insights into the mind of our fellow GitHub users. Some instances of engaging features are the list of most commented issues in GitHub, the list of oldest issues in GitHub, some of the most popular developers in GitHub and others. Some deep insights are that the most commented issue has around 16565 comments but the interesting fact is that it is a result of automation. The oldest unresolved bug is around _15 years old_. The most popular user is _Linus Torvalds_ with over _44100 followers_ whereas he follows none (contrary to the assumption that _more users I follow, the more users will follow me_) . <br>
* The second one is a user search service where the public profile details such as some users following the concerned user, some users being followed by the concerned user, the language usage distribution and some public information is displayed with respect to an username.
